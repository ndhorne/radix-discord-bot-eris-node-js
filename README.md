Radix Discord Bot

A general-purpose Discord bot powered by JavaScript, Node.js, and the Eris Node.js Discord library featuring chat-roomified renditions of familiar games such as Connect 4, Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, (Definitely Not) Wordle, and Nim (the matchstick game), alongside some likely unfamiliar originals such as Random Acts of ASCII; Multi-User Dungeons (aka MUDs) such as MUD Maze, a MUD where you traverse a maze in real time with other players; browsable galleries featuring the catalogs of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and long-running well-known web comics such as Bob the Angry Flower, Pokey the Penguin, and xkcd; and of course many of the standard amenities that discerning chat bot connoisseurs have come to expect a chat bot to provide such as dungeons and dragons dice, horoscopes, fortunes, magic 8 ball, currency converter, and many more. `$rdx help` to get started
